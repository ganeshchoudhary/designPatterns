Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.
* this is used to convert one object type to other type
* Examples
  * currency conversion if service uses only one type of currency than we need adaptor to make that work for other currency
  * entity to dto convertor 


* create adaptor interface 
  * implement that interface and create constructor with adapter
